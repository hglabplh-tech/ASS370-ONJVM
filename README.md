## ASS370-ONJVM

This project is designed to emulate ASS/370 and HLASM.
Doing so there will be a zOS emulator as well as a emulator for VM / CMS 
based on the control program of VM (CP). This includes disk management for CMS as well as 
management for VSAM and a 3270 emulator engine.
The PUN (puncher) and the RDR(reader) will be simulated as well
The other part is a VSE/CICS for running in a CMS user which has a special configuration.
The other line wil be zOS which is a OS based on the paradigmns of UNIX/LINUX.
The system is not only a emulator which emulates the hardware to interpret the 
compiled assembler but there will be a way to write out the binary code in the old 
object deck format as well as in the ELF format so that the code is runnable on a zOS 
VM/CMS .... without being changed.
